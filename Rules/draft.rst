For generations, you have been wandering through space aboard your capsule.
Finally, you arrive near this blue planet and you want to get in touch with its
inhabitants.

The first problem was to select the species that you should contact.  You
quickly decided to ignore the hairless bipeds, they feel nothing, hear almost
nothing and their only objective seem to be to destroy the planet. Marine
mammals are interesting but you do not like too much water.

You have finally decided that social insects are your target but you don't want
to be invasive. You will try to lure them where you have filed some chemical
substance containing your message.

Goal of the game
################

Be the first player that has lured the ant to each of his messages. This is
represented by cards played from the hand of the player in front of him.

Components
##########

* 1 anthill tile
* 1 ant
* 34 two sided tiles with a clockwise arrow on one side and a counter-clockwise
  arrow on the other side. One of the sides has a number on it.
* 34 cards numbered (one per tile)
* 2 pheromone tokens per player

Setup
#####

Remove the anthill tile, shuffle the other tiles face down. Shuffle the cards.
Give each player 8 tiles and deal all the cards. It's not a problem if one
player has more cards than the others at this point.

Each player selects 5 tiles and picks the corresponding cards he has. Then he
gives the remaining cards to the player on his left. Repeat until all players
have found all the cards that match their tiles.

Remove the unused cards from the game. Shuffle the tiles choosen by the players
with some tiles that were not choosen, you must have a total of 24 tiles + the
anthill tile.

Put the tiles numbered-face down in a 5x5 square with the anthill in the
center, each player takes his 2 pheromone tokens.
