A game by Ghislain "court-jus" Lévêque designed for the "In-A-Tin" contest.

Version 2

*For generations, you have been wandering through space aboard your capsule.
Finally, you arrive near this blue planet and you want to get in touch with its
inhabitants.*

*The first problem was to select the species that you should contact.  You
quickly decided to ignore the hairless bipeds, they feel nothing, hear almost
nothing and their only objective seem to be to destroy the planet. Marine
mammals are interesting but you do not like too much water.*

*You have finally decided that social insects are your target but you don't want
to be invasive. You will try to lure them where you have filed some chemical
substance containing your message.*

Goal of the game
################

Be the first player that has lured the ant to each of his messages. This is
represented by cards played from the hand of the player in front of him.

Components
##########

* 1 anthill tile
* 1 ant
* 34 two sided tiles with a clockwise arrow on one side and a counter-clockwise
  arrow on the other side. One of the sides has a number on it.
* 34 cards numbered (one per tile)
* 2 pheromone tokens per player (they have one visited side and one blank side)

Setup
#####

Remove the anthill tile, shuffle the other tiles face down. Shuffle the cards.
Give each player 8 tiles and deal all the cards. It's not a problem if one
player has more cards than the others at this point.

Each player selects 5 tiles and picks the corresponding cards he has. Then he
gives the remaining cards to the player on his left. Repeat until all players
have found all the cards that match their tiles.

Remove the unused cards from the game. Shuffle the tiles choosen by the players
with some tiles that were not choosen, you must have a total of 24 tiles + the
anthill tile.

Put the tiles numbered-face down in a 5x5 square with the anthill in the
center, each player takes his 2 pheromone tokens.

Choose a starting player.

The Game
########

Every player takes his turn until one of them manages to play every card from
his hand. This player is the winner. After one player's turn, the player on his
left goes next.

Game turn
=========

On your turn, start by turning the "visited" pheromones you own on the board back
to their "active" side. Then, you can take 3 actions that can be :

- move the ant
- play a pheromone token
- take a pheromone token back

You can use the same action more than once if you want.

Moving the ant
--------------

- If there is no pheromone token on any of the 4 tiles adjacent to the ant,
  rotate the ant 90° according to the arrow on its tile.
- Move the ant one tile in its direction. If there is a pheromone token on this
  new tile, turn it on it's "visited" side.
- If the is no pheromone token on the tile the ant just left, turn this tile so
  its arrow is inverted. 

If the ant left the map, it has gone too far, and is lost. This immediatly ends
your turn, even if you have not played 3 actions, give the ant to the player on
your left, he will put it on the anthill, facing any direction he chooses.

**Pheromones**

When there is one or more pheromone tokens on the tiles adjacent to the ant,
the ant does not follow the arrow on the tile, it follows the pheromones
(ignore the pheromones that are on the "visited" face):

- only 1 adjacent pheromone : the ant rotates in its direction
- more than 1 pheromones, some of them are owned by the current player : the
  current player chooses which of his pheromones the ant will follow
- more than 1 pheromones and none of them are owned by the current player : the
  current player chooses which pheromone the ant will follow

When there is a pheromone on the tile the ant is, the ant follows the tile's
arrow and the tile is not turned down when then ant leaves.

Playing a pheromone token
-------------------------

You can place one of your pheromone tokens on any free tile of the map (free as
"no ant, no token"). Put the token with the "blank" face up.

Taking a pheromone token back
-----------------------------

You can take back any of your pheromone token if it's not on the same tile as
the ant and if it's not adjacent to the ant.

Playing a card
==============

Anytime, even if it's not your turn, when the ant walks into a tile that is
face up and that matches one of your card or when the ant leaves a tile that is
then turned face up and matches one of your card, play that card.

If it was your last card, you won.
